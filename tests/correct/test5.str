      
I d been assigned to watch over Biologic s research team   so I once again found myself on the surface of SR     
It was there that I was attacked by a life form I had  never encountered before  
It was only later that I learned the identity of my  attacker  the parasitic organism we now know as X   Unaware of my condition  I was returning to the station  when disaster struck  
Once the X had infested my central nervous system  I lost  consciousness and my ship drifted into an asteroid belt  
The ship s emergency systems automatically ejected the  escape pod before impact  Biologic s vessel recovered it  and transported me to Galactic Federation HQ     However  during the journey  the X multiplied within me   corrupting large areas of my Power Suit  
It then came to light that the organic components of my  Power Suit had become so integrated with my system  that it could not be removed while I was unconscious  
Large portions of my suit had to be surgically removed   dramatically altering my physical appearance  However   the X in my central nervous system were too embedded to  be removed safely  I was given a minimal chance of survival  
Then  someone found a cure    They proposed using a Metroid cell to make an anti X vaccine   It seems that the Federation had managed to preserve a  cell culture from the last infant Metroid from SR      The serum was prepared and injected without delay  
The X parasites were immediately and completely  destroyed    As for me  one life ended    yet I survived  reborn  as something different  
Pondering this fact  I realize     I owe the Metroid hatchling my life twice over  
We ll soon be arriving at the B S L research station   I must prepare for docking
